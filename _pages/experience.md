#### **PhD Research Scholar/Assistant**  
*Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati*  
*July 2017 - June 2024*  
**PhD Title**: Bionic Reflex Control for an Optimized Underactuated Robotic Hand: A Reinforcement Learning Approach  
*Guide*: Prof. Shyamanta M. Hazarika  
- Design optimization of underactuated parameters of a robotic hand based on grasp quality measures using a population-based optimization algorithm.  
- Developed a bionic reflex controller using reinforcement learning (RL) for slippage and deformation prevention in an anthropomorphic robotic hand.  
- Enhanced the robustness of the RL-based bionic reflex controller through adaptive sliding mode control for efficient deployment.
